## üéØ About The Project

The goal of this project was to build a fully functional, responsive web app to help students revise from their coursebooks within a tight deadline. The core challenge was to move quickly without sacrificing quality, which necessitated the aggressive use of LLMs as a development partner.

LearnLens addresses a common problem for students: passive learning. Simply re-reading a textbook is often ineffective. This application makes learning active by:
1.  Allowing students to use their own PDF coursebooks as a source of truth.
2.  Generating a variety of questions (MCQs, Short & Long Answer) directly from the content.
3.  Providing instant feedback, scoring, and explanations to reinforce concepts.
4.  Offering a dashboard to visualize progress and identify areas for improvement.

This project was built as part of the BeyondChats assignment, with a focus on demonstrating rapid prototyping, feature implementation, and making smart architectural decisions under pressure.

## ü§ñ The Development Journey: How LLMs Were Used

As per the assignment's instructions, LLMs (specifically Gemini and GitHub Copilot) were used aggressively as a pair-programming tool to accelerate development. Here‚Äôs how:

1.  **Project Planning & Architecture:**
    * Brainstormed the initial tech stack and database schema.
    * Generated the day-by-day action plan, including API contracts (request/response shapes) and component prop definitions.

2.  **Code Scaffolding & Boilerplate:**
    * Generated the initial code for Next.js API routes, including Supabase client setup and request handling.
    * Created the basic structure for React components (e.g., `Quiz.tsx`, `PDFUploader.tsx`) with TypeScript interfaces.

3.  **Core Logic Implementation:**
    * **Prompt Engineering:** Iteratively designed and refined the core LLM prompt for the quiz generation engine, focusing on forcing reliable JSON output and high-quality explanations.
    * **Complex Functions:** Wrote helper functions for tasks like score calculation and data transformation.

4.  **Database & SQL:**
    * Generated the initial `CREATE TABLE` SQL scripts for the Supabase database schema.
    * Wrote boilerplate for Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) policies to secure user data.

5.  **Documentation & Debugging:**
    * Generated this `README.md` file based on a structured outline.
    * Helped debug issues by providing context-aware suggestions and explaining potential error causes.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The application follows a simple, scalable architecture:

1.  **Frontend (Next.js/React)**: The user interacts with the UI, which is rendered by Next.js on the server and client.
2.  **Backend (Next.js API Routes)**: The frontend communicates with our own backend API routes for actions like uploading files and generating quizzes.
3.  **Supabase**: Our backend API routes interact with Supabase for:
    * **Auth**: To manage user sessions.
    * **Storage**: To store uploaded PDF files.
    * **Database**: To persist user data, PDF metadata, and quiz attempts.
4.  **OpenAI API**: The `/api/generate-quiz` route sends the extracted PDF text to the OpenAI API and receives the structured quiz data back as JSON.

```
[User] <--> [Next.js Frontend] <--> [Next.js API Routes] <--> [OpenAI API]
                                         ^
                                         |
                                         v
                                    [Supabase (Auth, DB, Storage)]
```

## üöÄ Getting Started (Local Setup)

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later)
-   npm or yarn
-   A Supabase account (free tier is sufficient)
-   An OpenAI API key

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/learn-lens.git](https://github.com/your-username/learn-lens.git)
    cd learn-lens
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables**
    -   Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project.
    -   Copy the contents of `.env.local.example` into it.
    -   Fill in your Supabase Project URL, Anon Key, and your OpenAI API Key. You can find these in your Supabase and OpenAI dashboards.

    ```env
    # .env.local
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
    OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    ```

4.  **Run the development server**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

5.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## ü§î Tradeoffs & Decisions

Given the short timeframe, several strategic decisions were made:

-   **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) > Self-Hosted**: Chose Supabase over a custom Node.js/Express backend with a separate database to eliminate boilerplate and setup time for auth, storage, and database management.
-   **Component Library > Custom CSS**: Used Shadcn/ui to get a polished, professional look quickly, allowing more time to be spent on core application logic.
-   **Prioritizing Core Features**: Focused entirely on delivering the "Must-Have" features to a high standard rather than partially implementing all features. The Chat UI was deprioritized as it was a "Nice-to-Have".

---

## üîÆ Future Improvements

-   **Implement RAG for Chat**: Build the RAG pipeline using Supabase `pgvector` for highly accurate, cited answers.
-   **Improve Progress Tracking**: Add more granular analytics, such as performance by topic (by having the LLM tag questions).
-   **Caching**: Implement caching for generated quizzes to reduce redundant OpenAI API calls and lower costs.
-   **Batch Processing for PDFs**: For very large PDFs, text extraction and embedding should be handled as a background job to avoid timing out HTTP requests.
